What I Build

I don’t build dashboards. I build tools that remove manual work.

Typical projects:

🔹 Defender remediation automation

🔹 Intune and device lifecycle tooling

🔹 Tenant governance platforms

🔹 Microsoft Graph security tooling

🔹 Multi-tenant admin portals

Most repos here are production-style tools, scripts, or platform experiments.
